# Car-price-prediction-dashboard
This project uses Linear Regression to predict car prices, converting results into a CSV file. The data is preprocessed, the model trained and evaluated, and predictions made. The CSV is imported into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard, providing insights and visual analysis of car price data.
